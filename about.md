I am a freelance software developer with 20+ years of full-stack experience who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as part of a multi-disciplinary team.
My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From developing service-oriented JEE applications, to implementing a REST API driven Angular.JS frontend and provisioning a Linux application platform.
I prefer to work on a project in a multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a clear focus on the business case and in close collaboration with the stakeholders.
