While you are reading the magazine, ours is one of the tunes you can select.
The other tunes in the jukebox are by Laxity, Shogoon, Mutetus, Stinsen, Magnar, Fegolhuzz and Qdor, which is an impressive line-up to be part of!
Check out the amazing opening screen aswell, by Mirage:</description></item><item><title>Terminator 2 theme, from the Endoskull animation</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</guid><description>I did a little update on the Terminator theme from Big Angry Sprite. It is made for Honcho&amp;rsquo;s entry for the Skull Animation Compo on CSDB: Endoskull. I did not have much time, but I think this version is somewhat of an improvement. And guess what, this little production won 1st place!
P.S. the movie above is taken from the Anniversary Edition, which was released after the competition, and adds a nice opening title screen.</description></item><item><title>Muppetshow Theme, from the demo Subway Art</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</guid><description>A cover of the theme from The Muppetshow, made for the successor of the Commodore 64 demo Mahna Mahna, called Subway Art

For now it supports multicolor and hires bitmaps, so no sprites or FLI/AFLI. For that you still need the command line tool.
A new feature in this version is the ability to disable certain colors from the palette. This will make it to the command line version aswell, eventually.
The web version is 100% javascript running in your browser, there are no server-side components, so the images you convert never leave your computer.</description></item><item><title>Mahna Mahna, from the demo Mahna Mahna</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/mahnamahna/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/mahnamahna/</guid><description>Pssst&amp;hellip; I made the soundtrack to this Commodore 64 demo, but I did it incognito.

This is our entry to the &amp;ldquo;Last Night&amp;rdquo; melody competition on the Commodore 64 Scene Database, which was organised by Stinsen. The challenge was to come up with a melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made.
This was the starting point:

It can output images in the style of the c-64, and also executables that can be run on a real c-64.
Retropixels can be found on Github and in the npm repository
Moving towards a developer tool In this release, which is not backwards compatible, retropixels is moving more towards a developer tool for Commodore 64 fanatics.</description></item><item><title>Big Angry Sprite; going back to my Commodore 64 roots</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/big_angry_sprite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:24:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/big_angry_sprite/</guid><description>After 30 years of coding anything for the Commodore 64, I have released a small demo. Back in the 80s I started to teach myself programming on this machine, and I though it would be fun to revisit my coding roots.
The demoscene of the Commodore 64 is still very much alive, and seeing the amazing stuff that is coming out nowadays, I was motivated to try and add a little something to that.</description></item><item><title>Retropixels 0.7.1</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 19:07:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</guid><description>Retropixels is a cross-platform command line tool to convert images to a format that is supported by the legendary Commodore 64 (c-64) home computer.

In this first post I will go over some details on how this site was created.
The site is static HTML, generated by Hugo Sourcecode is accessible on Github The generated HTML is hosted on Github pages Based on the hugo-coder theme So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a fancy CMS like Wordpress, or a platform like Medium for example. The main reasons for doing it like this are:</description></item><item><title>Woop woop, an oldskool style HTML5 demo</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/1991/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/1991/</guid><description>In november 2013, a small, quite obscure demoscene gathering called &amp;lsquo;1991&amp;rsquo; took place in Scheveningen/Holland. My friend John wanted to release a HTML5 demo in 1991 style there, and asked me to contribute some parts to that. So here it is:

The bottom three parts in this overview screenshot are made by me. The one on the bottom left is a small tribute to Bas Bron&amp;rsquo;s video clip to You&amp;rsquo;ve got my love.</description></item><item><title>Earwax, 1st place in Beatbattle III</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/beatbattle3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2003 17:36:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/beatbattle3/</guid><description>My tune &amp;ldquo;Earwax&amp;rdquo; came first in the Renoise Beatbattle III!

Can you spot the trick in track 1 that makes the track swing &amp;rsquo;n shuffle?
P.S. The track plays twice because it is so short.</description></item><item><title>Trouble @ X97</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/trouble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 1997 17:23:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/trouble/</guid><description>This is our (me and my mate Marvin) entry to the X'97 Takeover music competition.
I started the tune at home and then finished it together with Marvin under less than ideal circumstances at the party place itself. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a little rough around the edges and basicly unfinished, but hey, there was a deadline and we made it!
We ended up getting a big applause and a low ranking in the results.</description></item><item><title>Surprise, from the X97 surprise competition</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/surprise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 1997 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/surprise/</guid><description>This is our (me and my mate Afzel) entry to the X'97 Takeover surprise music competition.
The surprise element of the music competition is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the competition was until shortly before the deadline. We were supplied with the samples to use in the tune, and some other limitations, which you can read in the information below.
According to that information we hurried through making this in less than half an hour, using Fasttracker II.</description></item><item><title>Iceball, a tune made in assembler code</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 1996 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</guid><description>A tune made in assembler code This tune was made on the Commodore 64 home computer somewhere in 1996. Although there were plenty of music editors to create music in by that time, I chose a very arcane way of doing things; by using assembler code.
The reason to do it like this is because I was after the specific sound of the excellent music routine by Laxity, and also to learn about how such a music routine works internally.</description></item><item><title>Bosswing (commodore 64 tune)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 1995 10:44:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</guid><description>A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using DMC 5.1+. As far as I know it has never been used in any Commodore 64 productions.
You can also find it on DeepSID. The styling of the video was done using Retropixels

I decided on a DYCP effect, a popular effect in the Commodore 64 demoscene.
The DYCP itself (the bouncy scroller) wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard; most effort and fun went into the music routine for the Soundblaster&amp;rsquo;s OPL2 (Yamaha YM3812) chip. This is the chip on the Soundblaster that was has a little FM synthesizer in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
