While you are reading the magazine, ours is one of the tunes you can select.
The other tunes in the jukebox are by Laxity, Shogoon, Mutetus, Stinsen, Magnar, Fegolhuzz and Qdor, which is an impressive line-up to be part of!
Check out the amazing opening screen aswell, by Mirage:</description></item><item><title>Terminator 2 theme, from the Endoskull animation</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</guid><description>I did a little update on the Terminator theme from Big Angry Sprite. It is made for Honcho&amp;rsquo;s entry for the Skull Animation Compo on CSDB: Endoskull. I did not have much time, but I think this version is somewhat of an improvement. And guess what, this little production won 1st place!
P.S. the movie above is taken from the Anniversary Edition, which was released after the competition, and adds a nice opening title screen.</description></item><item><title>Muppetshow Theme, from the demo Subway Art</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</guid><description>A cover of the theme from The Muppetshow, made for the successor of the Commodore 64 demo Mahna Mahna, called Subway Art

For now it supports multicolor and hires bitmaps, so no sprites or FLI/AFLI. For that you still need the command line tool.
A new feature in this version is the ability to disable certain colors from the palette. This will make it to the command line version aswell, eventually.
The web version is 100% javascript running in your browser, there are no server-side components, so the images you convert never leave your computer.</description></item><item><title>Mahna Mahna, from the demo Mahna Mahna</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/mahnamahna/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/mahnamahna/</guid><description>Pssst&amp;hellip; I made the soundtrack to this Commodore 64 demo, but I did it incognito.

This is our entry to the &amp;ldquo;Last Night&amp;rdquo; melody competition on the Commodore 64 Scene Database, which was organised by Stinsen. The challenge was to come up with a melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made.
This was the starting point:

Back in the 80s I started to teach myself programming on this machine, and I though it would be fun to revisit my coding roots.
The demoscene of the Commodore 64 is still very much alive, and seeing the amazing stuff that is coming out nowadays, I was motivated to try and add a little something to that.</description></item><item><title>Retropixels 0.7.1</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 19:07:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</guid><description>Retropixels is a cross-platform command line tool to convert images to a format that is supported by the legendary Commodore 64 (c-64) home computer.

My friend John wanted to release a HTML5 demo in 1991 style there, and asked me to contribute some parts to that. So here it is:

Although there were plenty of music editors to create music in by that time, I chose a very arcane way of doing things; by using assembler code.
The reason to do it like this is because I was after the specific sound of the excellent music routine by Laxity, and also to learn about how such a music routine works internally.</description></item><item><title>Bosswing (commodore 64 tune)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 1995 10:44:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</guid><description>A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using DMC 5.1+. As far as I know it has never been used in any Commodore 64 productions. It has been used in this little fireworks display.
You can also find it on DeepSID. The styling of the video was done using Retropixels

The pictures were made by my cousin &amp;ldquo;Hires&amp;rdquo;, and by myself, &amp;ldquo;Mad B&amp;rdquo;. I had just figured out how to display a multicolor picture, and how to play a soundmonitor tune.
