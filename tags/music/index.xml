Can you spot the trick in track 1 that makes the track swing &amp;lsquo;n shuffle?

I decided on a DYCP effect, a popular effect in the Commodore 64 demoscene.
The DYCP itself (the bouncy scroller) wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard; most effort and fun went into the music routine for the Soundblaster&amp;lsquo;s OPL2 (Yamaha YM3812) chip. This is the chip on the Soundblaster that was has a little FM synthesizer in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
