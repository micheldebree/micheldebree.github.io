Broware, by Laxity, Youth and SMC Even though my contribution is pretty minimal, it was good fun working with these guys because I am a big fan of their music, and they are very cool guys on top of that!</description></item><item><title>Sunkissed, from the Vandalism #72 soundtrack</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/sunkissed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/sunkissed/</guid><description>We made an exclusive background tune for the 72nd issue of the Commodore 64 disk magazine Vandalism News. While you are reading the magazine, ours is one of the tunes you can select.
The other tunes in the jukebox are by Laxity, Shogoon, Mutetus, Stinsen, Magnar, Fegolhuzz and Qdor, which is an impressive line-up to be part of!
Check out the amazing opening screen aswell, by Mirage:</description></item><item><title>Terminator 2 theme, from the Endoskull animation</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</guid><description>I did a little update on the Terminator theme from Big Angry Sprite. It is made for Honcho&amp;rsquo;s entry for the Skull Animation Compo on CSDB: Endoskull. I did not have much time, but I think this version is somewhat of an improvement. And guess what, this little production won 1st place!
P.S. the movie above is taken from the Anniversary Edition, which was released after the competition, and adds a nice opening title screen.</description></item><item><title>Muppetshow Theme, from the demo Subway Art</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</guid><description>A cover of the theme from The Muppetshow, made for the successor of the Commodore 64 demo Mahna Mahna, called Subway Art

This is our entry to the &amp;ldquo;Last Night&amp;rdquo; melody competition on the Commodore 64 Scene Database, which was organised by Stinsen. The challenge was to come up with a melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made.
This was the starting point:

For this competition the participants were limited to a fixed set of samples you were allowed to use, and a maximum file size of 400kb.</description></item><item><title>Smart 4, a worktune</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/smart4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1998 17:23:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/smart4/</guid><description>A short little jam. Can you spot the trick in track 1 that makes the track swing &amp;rsquo;n shuffle?
P.S. The track plays twice because it is so short.</description></item><item><title>Trouble @ X97</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/trouble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 1997 17:23:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/trouble/</guid><description>This is our (me and my mate Marvin) entry to the X'97 Takeover music competition.
I started the tune at home and then finished it together with Marvin under less than ideal circumstances at the party place itself. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a little rough around the edges and basicly unfinished, but hey, there was a deadline and we made it!
We ended up getting a big applause and a low ranking in the results.</description></item><item><title>Surprise, from the X97 surprise competition</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/surprise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 1997 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/surprise/</guid><description>This is our (me and my mate Afzel) entry to the X'97 Takeover surprise music competition.
The surprise element of the music competition is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the competition was until shortly before the deadline. We were supplied with the samples to use in the tune, and some other limitations, which you can read in the information below.
According to that information we hurried through making this in less than half an hour, using Fasttracker II.</description></item><item><title>That time we went to The Party 6</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/theparty6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 1996 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/theparty6/</guid><description>Late 1996, we got it into our minds to go visit a demoscene party in Denmark, The Party 6. Although we had left our Commodore 64 days behind at that time, we were still sort of forming a group called &amp;ldquo;Heatwave&amp;rdquo;, making music on Amiga and PC.
We thought it would be cool to go to a big, popular party where demosceners of multiple platforms were present. So off we went (me, Hires, Yavin, Yanic and Yinxs), traveling in Hires&amp;rsquo; car from Leiden in the Netherlands, to Aars in Denmark, some 900+ kilometers.</description></item><item><title>Iceball, a tune made in assembler code</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 1996 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</guid><description>A tune made in assembler code Link to heading This tune was made on the Commodore 64 home computer somewhere in 1996. Although there were plenty of music editors to create music in by that time, I chose a very arcane way of doing things; by using assembler code.
The reason to do it like this is because I was after the specific sound of the excellent music routine by Laxity, and also to learn about how such a music routine works internally.</description></item><item><title>Bosswing (commodore 64 tune)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 1995 10:44:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</guid><description>A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using DMC 5.1+. As far as I know it has never been used in any Commodore 64 productions. It has been used in this little fireworks display.
You can also find it on DeepSID. The styling of the video was done using Retropixels

I decided on a DYCP effect, a popular effect in the Commodore 64 demoscene.
The DYCP itself (the bouncy scroller) wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard; most effort and fun went into the music routine for the Soundblaster&amp;rsquo;s OPL2 (Yamaha YM3812) chip. This is the chip on the Soundblaster that was has a little FM synthesizer in it.</description></item><item><title>Eddies Adventure (commodore 64 demo)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/eddies_adventure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 1991 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/eddies_adventure/</guid><description>1991 marked the end of the Commodore 64 era of out little democoding group &amp;ldquo;Heatwave&amp;rdquo;. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time but we must have felt we wanted to go out with a bang, and make a megademo in which we made everything ourselves.
It was quite common practice to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; resources like music and fonts from other demos or games. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do any of that this time.</description></item></channel></rss>
