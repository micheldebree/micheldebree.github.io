In this first post I will go over some details on how this site was created.
The site is static HTML, generated by Hugo Sourcecode is accessible on Github The generated HTML is hosted on Github pages Based on the hugo-coder theme So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a fancy CMS like Wordpress, or a platform like Medium for example. Why is that?
I don&amp;rsquo;t need fancy stuff that requires session management, a database, authorization etc.</description></item><item><title>DYCP and music routine on a 386 PC</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/dycp-386/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 1994 18:06:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/dycp-386/</guid><description>Coming from the Commodore 64 and being used to coding in assembler, I tried to do the same on my dad&amp;rsquo;s 386 PC. I decided on a DYCP effect, a popular effect in the Commodore 64 demoscene.
The DYCP itself (the bouncy scroller) wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard; most effort and fun went into the music routine for the Soundblaster&amp;lsquo;s OPL2 (Yamaha YM3812) chip. This is the chip on the Soundblaster that was has a little FM synthesizer in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
