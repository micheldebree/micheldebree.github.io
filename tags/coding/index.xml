For now it supports multicolor and hires bitmaps, so no sprites or FLI/AFLI. For that you still need the command line tool.
A new feature in this version is the ability to disable certain colors from the palette. This will make it to the command line version aswell, eventually.
The web version is 100% javascript running in your browser, there are no server-side components, so the images you convert never leave your computer.</description></item><item><title>Retropixels 0.8.0 released</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-8-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:24:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-8-0/</guid><description>Retropixels is a cross-platform command line tool to convert images to a format that is supported by the legendary Commodore 64 (c-64) home computer.

Moving towards a developer tool In this release, which is not backwards compatible, retropixels is moving more towards a developer tool for Commodore 64 fanatics.</description></item><item><title>Big Angry Sprite; going back to my Commodore 64 roots</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/big_angry_sprite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:24:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/big_angry_sprite/</guid><description>After 30 years of coding anything for the Commodore 64, I have released a small demo. Back in the 80s I started to teach myself programming on this machine, and I though it would be fun to revisit my coding roots.
The demoscene of the Commodore 64 is still very much alive, and seeing the amazing stuff that is coming out nowadays, I was motivated to try and add a little something to that.</description></item><item><title>Retropixels 0.7.1 released</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 19:07:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/</guid><description>Retropixels is a cross-platform command line tool to convert images to a format that is supported by the legendary Commodore 64 (c-64) home computer.

New in this version In this new version, you can choose between a couple of color palettes, and also a color space to use when the image is quantized, with two new arguments:</description></item><item><title>I built a new personal website with Hugo</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome to my website. In this first post I will go over some details on how this site was created.
The site is static HTML, generated by Hugo Sourcecode is accessible on Github The generated HTML is hosted on Github pages Based on the hugo-coder theme So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a fancy CMS like Wordpress, or a platform like Medium for example. The main reasons for doing it like this are:</description></item><item><title>DYCP and music routine on a 386 PC</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/dycp-386/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 1994 18:06:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/dycp-386/</guid><description>Coming from the Commodore 64 and being used to coding in assembler, I tried to do the same on my dad&amp;rsquo;s 386 PC. I decided on a DYCP effect, a popular effect in the Commodore 64 demoscene.
The DYCP itself (the bouncy scroller) wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard; most effort and fun went into the music routine for the Soundblaster&amp;rsquo;s OPL2 (Yamaha YM3812) chip. This is the chip on the Soundblaster that was has a little FM synthesizer in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
