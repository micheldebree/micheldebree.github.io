Broware, by Laxity, Youth and SMC Even though my contribution is pretty minimal, it was good fun working with these guys because I am a big fan of their music, and they are very cool guys on top of that!</description></item><item><title>Sunkissed, from the Vandalism #72 soundtrack</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/sunkissed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/sunkissed/</guid><description>We made an exclusive background tune for the 72nd issue of the Commodore 64 disk magazine Vandalism News. While you are reading the magazine, ours is one of the tunes you can select.
The other tunes in the jukebox are by Laxity, Shogoon, Mutetus, Stinsen, Magnar, Fegolhuzz and Qdor, which is an impressive line-up to be part of!
Check out the amazing opening screen aswell, by Mirage:</description></item><item><title>Terminator 2 theme, from the Endoskull animation</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/endoskull/</guid><description>I did a little update on the Terminator theme from Big Angry Sprite. It is made for Honcho&amp;rsquo;s entry for the Skull Animation Compo on CSDB: Endoskull. I did not have much time, but I think this version is somewhat of an improvement. And guess what, this little production won 1st place!
P.S. the movie above is taken from the Anniversary Edition, which was released after the competition, and adds a nice opening title screen.</description></item><item><title>Muppetshow Theme, from the demo Subway Art</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/muppetshow/</guid><description>A cover of the theme from The Muppetshow, made for the successor of the Commodore 64 demo Mahna Mahna, called Subway Art

This is our entry to the &amp;ldquo;Last Night&amp;rdquo; melody competition on the Commodore 64 Scene Database, which was organised by Stinsen. The challenge was to come up with a melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made.
This was the starting point:

Back in the 80s I started to teach myself programming on this machine, and I though it would be fun to revisit my coding roots.
The demoscene of the Commodore 64 is still very much alive, and seeing the amazing stuff that is coming out nowadays, I was motivated to try and add a little something to that.</description></item><item><title>Iceball, a tune made in assembler code</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 1996 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/iceball/</guid><description>A tune made in assembler code Link to heading This tune was made on the Commodore 64 home computer somewhere in 1996. Although there were plenty of music editors to create music in by that time, I chose a very arcane way of doing things; by using assembler code.
The reason to do it like this is because I was after the specific sound of the excellent music routine by Laxity, and also to learn about how such a music routine works internally.</description></item><item><title>Bosswing (commodore 64 tune)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 1995 10:44:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/bosswing/</guid><description>A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using DMC 5.1+. As far as I know it has never been used in any Commodore 64 productions. It has been used in this little fireworks display.
You can also find it on DeepSID. The styling of the video was done using Retropixels

We didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time but we must have felt we wanted to go out with a bang, and make a megademo in which we made everything ourselves.
It was quite common practice to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; resources like music and fonts from other demos or games. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do any of that this time.</description></item><item><title>Fontastic (commodore 64 utility)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/fontastic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 1990 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/fontastic/</guid><description>After the thrill of making money from coding with Solitair, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try again and made a utility for drawing your own fonts on the Commodore 64, called Fontastic.
I sent it off to &amp;ldquo;Magic Disk 64&amp;rdquo; again, and got a letter back saying they liked it and were willing to pay for it:
And sure enough, a few months later I saw the magazine with my tool on it in the shop:</description></item><item><title>Solitair (commodore 64 game)</title><link>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/solitair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 1990 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/solitair/</guid><description>The first time I was ever payed for practising one of my biggest hobbies was in 1990, when I was 17 years old. I heard about this disk magazine called &amp;ldquo;Magic Disk 64&amp;rdquo;. This was a magazine you bought in a magazine shop, but instead of it having physical pages, it only had a cover, a piece of cardboard and a floppy disk inside. On the floppy disks was software that was written by amateurs and sold to the magazine.</description></item></channel></rss>
