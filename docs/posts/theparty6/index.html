<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Yavin, Yanic and me made a tune for the music competitions. It was probably the
first time I made a tune that competed at a demoscene party. It was great to see
my name on the big screen and hear the music echo through the big party hall
during the competition.</p><p><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/theparty6/yth-olohof97.mp3 type=audio/mpeg></audio><figcaption>Olohof '97 by me, 19th place in the multichannel music compo</figcaption></figure><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/theparty6/yav-motownfunk.mp3 type=audio/mpeg></audio><figcaption>Motown Funk by Yavin, 21st place in the 4-channel music compo</figcaption></figure><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://www.micheldebree.nl/posts/theparty6/yan-thehappyparty.mp3 type=audio/mpeg></audio><figcaption>The Happy Party by Yanic, 23rd place in the 4-channel music compo</figcaption></figure></p><p>We didn&rsquo;t end up very high in the charts.
