This Saturday the Commodore 64 demo [Cheech Wizard 5](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=257555) made its debut at the
[Transmission 64](https://transmission64.com/) online demoparty. I did a small cover of [JT in
Space](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=%2FMUSICIANS%2FT%2FTel_Jeroen%2FJT_in_Space.sid) to go with it.

This little demo refers back to an iconic little demo by Ash & Dave from 1988, [Double
Density](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIdrqWNiGrY). The original tune by Jeroen Tel holds a special place in my heart because it
was the first time I heard a bassline and sound effects like that. I was blown away. This tune made me want to make SIDs myself.

I made a little mistake; I left my handle "Youth" in the metadata instead of my Muppet alter-ego "Animal". Someone found out and it [blew my
cover](https://csdb.dk/forums/?roomid=12&topicid=174400#174432).
