When I got the chance to collaborate on a [SID](/tags/sid) tune with two of my all-time heroes Laxity and SMC on [Broware](/posts/broware), it couldn't get any better than that... so I thought.

Turns out it could... by having Broware covered by the amazing [Mordi](https://soundcloud.com/mordi-1)! I have been a fan of Mordi's tunes for a long time so I'm very chuffed by this cover!
