This weekend I spent at [X2023](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3187) in Someren,
Holland. X is a bi-annual Commodore 64
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) event where creative
enthousiasts gather from all over Europe (and some from further away even!). We
get to meet friends we made online, talk to others who's work we admire, and
have a big shootout in one of the competitions. There are competitions for music
and graphics, but the big banger on saturday night is the demo competition.

You can download "Staying Alive" at the
[CSDb](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=232978), or just read some of the comments
there.

I have been to a couple of X parties, but this was the first time I had
something to show on the big screen, so that was a lot of fun!

I also got to meet some new friends, and catch up with old friends:
