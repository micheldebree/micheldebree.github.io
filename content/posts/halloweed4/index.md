This Saturday the Commodore 64 demo [Halloweed 4](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=247767) made its debut at the
[Transmission 64](https://transmission64.com/) online demoparty. I was guest
starring on this production by [Xenon](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=153), a dutch demoscene group. [WVL](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=1119) did
all the groundbreaking code (and sharpened a few world records).

I wanted to use
some well known horror themes, and landed on the iconic arpeggio of [Mike
Oldfield's Tubular Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN6jIvKiYOs) (used in
[The Exorcist](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9552-the-exorcist)) and a cover
of [Michael Jackson's Thriller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsuEjAw5hg0) (R.I.P. Quincy Jones)
