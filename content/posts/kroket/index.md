On Christmas morning, [Vandalism News issue 75](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=248533) dropped! It was a privilege to supply a track for the soundtrack again. This time it was a coop tune with [Vincenzo](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=4559), who took the track into full party mode. You can listen on an emulator via 
[DeepSID](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/SID%20Happens/Full_of_Kroket.sid), or check out the recording below, which was made on the real hardware.
