This weekend I spent at [X2024](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3187) in Someren,
Holland. X is a bi-annual Commodore 64
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) event where creative
enthusiasts gather from all over Europe (and some from further away even!). We
get to meet friends we made online, talk to others who's work we admire, and
have a big shootout in one of the competitions. There are competitions for music
and graphics, but the big banger on saturday night is the demo competition.

Last year I entered the demo competition with [Staying Alive](/posts/staying_alive), this time I had an original tune for
the [music competition](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3294). By the time I got to the party my tune still had some large gaps that needed to be filled, but after a day of work on friday I managed to get something decent before the 19:00 deadline:
