This weekend I spent at [X2024](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3187) in Someren, Holland. X is a bi-annual Commodore 64
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) event where creative enthusiasts gather from all over Europe (and some from
further away even!). We get to meet friends we made online, talk to others who's work we admire, and have a big shootout in one of
the competitions. There are competitions for music and graphics, but the big banger on saturday night is the demo competition.

Last year I entered the demo competition with [Staying Alive](/posts/staying_alive), this time I had an original tune for the [music
competition](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3294). By the time I got to the party my tune still had some large gaps that needed to be
filled, but after a day of work on friday I managed to get something decent before the 19:00 deadline:

It was actually a good thing that the deadline for the music competition was quite early this time (on friday night). The next day
there was a [presentation](/sf2_and_asid) planned by Tubesockor and me, so after we both entered our tunes into the competetion (and
had some well-deserved beers), we had some distractrion-free time to work on the presentation.
